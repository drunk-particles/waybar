# Waybar Themes for opinionated Omarchy

###### A collection of my Waybar themes – have fun exploring and customizing them!



## Usability

These configs are Omarchy-based, including optional Omarchy-specific modules (logo, screen recorder, update module, cava, waycat, weather,mpris).
Aside from that, they use standard modules (e.g. pacman updates, wttrbar), so they can be used on any distro by simply removing the Omarchy modules and define colors.

## Instructions

My Waybar configurations use additional packages such as wttrbar (weahter module) and waybar-cava-module-update-git (pacman AUR updates).

yay -S waybar-module-pacman-updates-git
yay -S wttrbar
